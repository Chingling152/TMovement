# The World [W.I.P]
The world is now under refactor... the idea is to be a collection of customizable and flexible libraries

For now thoses are the Libraries
- [ ] TiMovi - Tile Movement Library [W.I.P]
- [ ] The Chest - Inventory System [W.I.P]
- [ ] Unity Extended - Extension methods to build-in classes [in other repos]

This is a test, ideas aren't welcome yet.
